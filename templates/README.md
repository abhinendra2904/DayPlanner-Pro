# DayPlanner Pro

## Project Overview
DayPlanner Pro is a Flask web application designed to help users schedule and manage their daily tasks using natural language input.  
Users can enter tasks in the format "Task on YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM" and the app intelligently parses the input, detects scheduling conflicts, and manages the task list with options to add, edit, or delete tasks.

## Features
- Add tasks using a simple natural language format: Task on YYYY-MM-DD at HH:MM  
- Edit existing tasks easily  
- Delete tasks when they are no longer needed  
- Conflict detection to prevent overlapping tasks at the same date and time  
- Clean and responsive UI built with Flask and Bootstrap for better user experience

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- Flask web framework

## Future Improvements
- Integrate advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) for better task understanding  
- Add persistent storage (SQLite database or JSON files) to save tasks between app restarts  
- Implement task reminders and notifications (email, SMS, or in-app)  
- Deploy the application online for easy access from anywhere
